**Privacy Policy for SPECTRESTATS**
Last Updated: October 20, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how SPECTRESTATS ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use our Chrome extension. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency.

**1. Data Processing and Storage (Privacy First)**

SPECTRESTATS is designed with a strong emphasis on user privacy and local data handling.

* **Local Processing:** All historical activity data, which you provide by manually uploading your archive files from `stake.com`, is processed **exclusively on your local computer** within your browser. This data is never transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers.
* **Local Storage:** The processed historical summaries and related information derived from your files are stored locally on your machine using the browser's built-in IndexedDB storage. This allows the extension to display your visualized data without re-processing files each time and ensures your detailed information remains on your device.

**2. Data Sharing for Community Insights (Optional & Anonymous)**

To provide general insights about game activity trends across the user base (e.g., overall popularity or aggregated metrics for specific games), SPECTRESTATS shares a **strictly limited, anonymous, and aggregated** set of data with our secure backend (Supabase). Participation in this feature is inherent to using the community tab but involves no personal data.

* **What We Share Anonymously:**
    * **Aggregated Game Statistics:** For specific games encountered across all users, we share *combined totals* (e.g., total count of activities, total turnover volume) without linking data to any individual.
    * **Anonymized High-Value Events:** Notable event data (e.g., high multipliers achieved within a game) may be shared *without any user identifiers*.
    * **Anonymous User ID:** A randomly generated ID helps distinguish contributions from different installations for aggregation accuracy but cannot be used to identify you personally.

* **What We Absolutely DO NOT Share:**
    * Your `stake.com` username or any personal account details.
    * Your IP address or specific location information.
    * Your detailed, individual activity history or personal usage patterns.
    * Any file contents you upload.
    * Any data that could reasonably be used to link the anonymous aggregated data back to you.

The **sole purpose** of sharing this anonymous, aggregated data is to power the optional "Community Stats" feature, providing general game trend information. It is **never** used for user tracking or profiling.

**3. Advertising**

SPECTRESTATS does not currently display advertisements. If this changes in the future:

* **No Personal Data for Ads:** We commit to *never* using your locally processed activity data, history, or any sensitive personal information derived from your uploaded files for advertising purposes.
* **Contextual or General Ads:** Any potential future ads would be general or based on non-personal context (like the site being viewed), not on your individual activity data.

**4. Your Control and Data Deletion**

You maintain full control over your locally stored data.

* **Data Deletion:** By using the "Clear Data" button within the extension, you can **permanently delete all locally stored activity information** derived from your uploaded files from your browser's storage at any time. This action only affects your local data and cannot be undone.

**5. Changes to This Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. We encourage you to review it periodically. Significant changes will be communicated through the extension's store listing or interface. Your continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.

**6. Contact Us**
