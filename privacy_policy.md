Privacy Policy for SPECTRESTATS
Last Updated: October 10, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how SPECTRESTATS ("we", "us", or "our") handles your information when you use our Chrome extension. Your privacy is our top priority.

1. Data Processing and Storage
SPECTRESTATS is designed with a "privacy-first" approach.

Local Processing: All of your personal betting data, which you provide by uploading your bet archive files from online gaming platforms, is processed exclusively on your local computer within your browser. This data is never transmitted to our servers or any third party.

Local Storage: The processed statistics and bet information are stored locally on your machine using the browser's built-in IndexedDB storage. This allows the extension to function without needing to re-process your files every time you open it.

2. Data Sharing and Community Features
To provide community-level insights, SPECTRESTATS shares a limited, completely anonymous, and aggregated set of data with our secure Supabase backend.

What We Share:

Aggregated game statistics (e.g., for a specific game, we might share the total number of bets, total amount wagered, and total payout across all users for that game).

Top individual bet results (wins, losses, multipliers) without any personally identifiable information.

A randomly generated, anonymous user ID to distinguish aggregated data from different users without identifying who you are.

What We DO NOT Share:

Your platform username or any personal account details.

Your IP address.

Your individual bet history or patterns.

Any information that could be used to link your anonymous data back to you.

The purpose of sharing this anonymous data is solely to power the "Community Stats" feature, allowing you to compare your performance against a broader, privacy-respecting dataset.

3. Advertising and Promotions
In the future, SPECTRESTATS may display advertisements or promotional codes for third-party platforms. Our commitment to privacy extends to our advertising practices:

No Personal Data for Ads: We will not use your personal betting data, history, or any sensitive information to target advertisements.

Contextual Ads: Advertisements that may be displayed will be general in nature or based on non-personal context, such as the game or platform you are currently viewing. Your individual performance data will not be used for ad targeting.

4. Your Control
You have full control over your data. By using the "Clear Data" button within the extension, you can permanently delete all locally stored betting information from your browser at any time. This action cannot be undone.

5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the extension's store listing.
